    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The incredible throughput of data being produced by the biological community sorrounding the cell has exceeded even the wildest predictions, with no sign of abating. Although the amassing of data is useful, we have recently come up against a new issue, how do we make sense and extract meaningful results from this seemingly vast sea of amorphous data? The attempt here was to overall bring a physicality to the correlational, something to anchor and interpret all our sequencing results in a hierarchical manner which is intuitive and easy to use. The design of this is built to be modular, hopefully continuing to evolve and increase its ability to aid the biologist in their physical perturbation of a an organism's genome."
