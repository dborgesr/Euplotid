    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of building Euplotid began with taking raw sequencing reads stored in a few different formats and processing it all the way to quantified values. Due to the pliability, breadth, and flexibility of the methods they will be documented within their own Jupyter notebook. Acting as both the documentation and the pipeline itself this format allows for seamless data integration.\n",
