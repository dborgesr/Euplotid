// Euplotid arduino code control adapted from: WhiteBox Labs -- Tentacle Shield -- I2C interactive example
// https://www.whiteboxes.ch/tentacle
//
// How to use 4 (or 8 if using 2 Tentacle shields) Atlas Scientivic devices in I2C mode
// and interact with them via the serial monitor.
//
// This code is intended to work on all Arduinos. If using the Arduino Yun, connect
// to it's serial port. If you want to work with the Yun wirelessly, check out the respective
// Yun version of this example.
//
// USAGE:
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - Set all your EZO circuits to I2C before using this sketch.
//    - You can use the "tentacle-steup.ino" sketch to do so)
//    - Make sure each circuit has a unique I2C ID set 
// - Set host serial terminal to 9600 baud
//
// - To send a command, send the number of the i2c address, a colon and the command ending with a carriage return.
//
// - To issue a command, enter it directly to the console.
