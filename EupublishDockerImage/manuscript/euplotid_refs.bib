  abstract = {Summary
The pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is produced by active transcription of genes that control cell identity and repression of genes encoding lineage-specifying developmental regulators. Here, we use ESC cohesin ChIA-PET data to identify the local chromosomal structures at both active and repressed genes across the genome. The results produce a map of enhancer-promoter interactions and reveal that super-enhancer-driven genes generally occur within chromosome structures that are formed by the looping of two interacting CTCF sites co-occupied by cohesin. These looped structures form insulated neighborhoods whose integrity is important for proper expression of local genes. We also find that repressed genes encoding lineage-specifying developmental regulators occur within insulated neighborhoods. These results provide insights into the relationship between transcriptional control of cell identity genes and control of local chromosome structure.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

To devise this map, we identified transcriptional enhancers and insulators in these cells and placed them within the context of cohesin-associated CTCF-CTCF loops using cohesin ChIA-PET data. The CTCF-CTCF loops we identified form a chromosomal framework of insulated neighborhoods, which in turn form topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely preserved during the transition between the naive and primed states. Regulatory changes in enhancer-promoter interactions occur within insulated neighborhoods during cell state transition. The CTCF anchor regions we identified are conserved across species, influence gene expression, and are a frequent site of mutations in cancer cells, underscoring their functional importance in cellular regulation. These 3D regulatory maps of human pluripotent cells therefore provide a foundation for future interrogation of the relationships between chromosome structure and gene control in development and disease.},

Our genomes have complex three-dimensional (3D) arrangements that partition and regulate gene expression. Cancer cells frequently have their genomes grossly rearranged, disturbing this intricate 3D organization. Hnisz et al. show that the disruption of these 3D neighborhoods can bring oncogenes under the control of regulatory elements normally kept separate from them (see the Perspective by Wala and Beroukim). These novel juxtapositions can result in the inappropriate activation of oncogenes.
Science, this issue p. 1454; see also p. 1398
Oncogenes are activated through well-known chromosomal alterations such as gene fusion, translocation, and focal amplification. In light of recent evidence that the control of key genes depends on chromosome structures called insulated neighborhoods, we investigated whether proto-oncogenes occur within these structures and whether oncogene activation can occur via disruption of insulated neighborhood boundaries in cancer cells. We mapped insulated neighborhoods in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and found that tumor cell genomes contain recurrent microdeletions that eliminate the boundary sites of insulated neighborhoods containing prominent T-ALL proto-oncogenes. Perturbation of such boundaries in nonmalignant cells was sufficient to activate proto-oncogenes. Mutations affecting chromosome neighborhood boundaries were found in many types of cancer. Thus, oncogene activation can occur via genetic alterations that disrupt insulated neighborhoods in malignant cells.
Disrupting the boundaries between three-dimensional neighborhoods in the genome can activate cancer-promoting genes. [Also see Perspective by Wala and Beroukim]

  abstract = {It has been repeatedly proposed to expand the scope for SETI, and one of the suggested alternatives to radio is the biological media. Genomic DNA is already used on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity, but stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible mapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying the code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over cosmological timescales; in fact, it is the most durable construct known. Therefore it represents an exceptionally reliable storage for an intelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic requirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far from being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally cannot be ruled out. A statistically strong intelligent-like ``signal'' in the genetic code is then a testable consequence of such scenario. Here we show that the terrestrial code displays a thorough precision-type orderliness matching the criteria to be considered an informational signal. Simple arrangements of the code reveal an ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of the same symbolic language. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a product of precision logic and nontrivial computing rather than of stochastic processes (the null hypothesis that they are due to chance coupled with presumable evolutionary pathways is rejected with P-value \&lt; 10\textendash{}13). The patterns are profound to the extent that the code mapping itself is uniquely deduced from their algebraic representation. The signal displays readily recognizable hallmarks of artificiality, among which are the symbol of zero, the privileged decimal syntax and semantical symmetries. Besides, extraction of the signal involves logically straightforward but abstract operations, making the patterns essentially irreducible to any natural origin. Plausible ways of embedding the signal into the code and possible interpretation of its content are discussed. Overall, while the code is nearly optimized biologically, its limited capacity is used extremely efficiently to pass non-biological information.},

We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as ``modularity'' over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

The time-scale of the process acts as an intrinsic parameter that uncovers community structures at different resolutions. The stability extends and unifies standard notions for community detection: modularity and spectral partitioning can be seen as limiting cases of our dynamic measure. Similarly, recently proposed multi-resolution methods correspond to linearisations of the stability at short times. The connection between community detection and Laplacian dynamics enables us to establish dynamically motivated stability measures linked to distinct null models. We apply our method to find multi-scale partitions for different networks and show that the stability can be computed efficiently for large networks with extended versions of current algorithms.},

Moreover, our data suggest that CTCF-dependent boundary function can be modulated by competing forces, such as the self-assembly of polycomb domains within the nucleus. Therefore, CTCF boundaries are not merely static structural components of the genome but instead are locally dynamic regulatory structures that control gene expression during development.},

However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1\textendash{}3 nucleosome (50\textendash{}500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA\textendash{}DNA contacts that are spatially proximal.

We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome\textendash{}nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres.},

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes are folded in a hierarchy of topologically associating domains (TADs), subTADs and looping interactions. The nested nature of chromatin domains has rendered it challenging to identify a sensitive and specific metric for detecting subTADs and quantifying their dynamic reconfiguration across cellular states. Here, we apply graph theoretic principles to quantify hierarchical folding patterns in high-resolution chromatin topology maps. We discover that TADs can be accurately detected using a Louvain-like locally greedy algorithm to maximize network modularity. By varying a resolution parameter in the modularity quality function, we accurately partition the mouse genome across length scales into a hierarchical nested structure of network communities exhibiting a wide range of sizes. To distinguish high probability subTADs from the full detected set, we developed and applied a new hierarchical spatial variance minimization method. Moreover, we identified a large number of dynamically altered communities between pluripotent embryonic stem cells and multipotent neural progenitor cells. Cell type specific boundaries correlate with trends in dynamic occupancy of the architectural protein CTCF, thereby validating their biological relevance. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of metrics from network science in quantifying a nested hierarchy of dynamic 3D chromatin communities across length scales. Our findings are significant toward unraveling the link between higher-order genome folding and gene expression during healthy development and the deregulation of molecular pathways linked to disease.},

  abstract = {The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanism. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance - deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce an open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

  abstract = {Subtelomeric macrosatellite repeats are difficult to sequence using conventional sequencing methods owing to the high similarity among repeat units and high GC content. Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype of the telomeric sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.7\% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may become a new standard for the molecular diagnosis of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of repetitive subtelomeric regions.},

  abstract = {The simian virus 40 (SV40) origin region includes the viral replication origin and the early and late promoters and consists of a few palindromes, a 17-base-pair (bp) A + T-rich sequence, three copies of a G + C-rich 21-bp repeat, and two copies of a 72-bp repeat. We have made sequential deletions in the SV40 origin region and determined the early promoter efficiencies of these truncated DNA segments by connecting them in the correct orientation with the coding regions of selectable marker genes and assaying the expression of the chimeric marker genes in vivo in different host cell lines. A truncated SV40 early promoter segment containing only the TATA box and the major in vivo mRNA initiation sites has essentially no promoter efficiency. We have located the major component of the SV40 early promoter within the 21-bp repeated sequences, which consist of an alternating and mutually overlapping array of two C-rich oligonucleotides having the consensus sequences Y-Y-C-C-G-C-C-C (Y = pyrimidine nucleoside) and G-C-C-C-(C)-TA-AT-A(T)-C-T. Between one and two copies of the 21-bp repeat were adequate for gene expression under conditions in which the enhancement effect of the 72-bp repeat was minimal. We also find that the SV40 72-bp repeat exhibits a pronounced host range in its enhancement of gene expression; the enhancement is only 2-fold in the nonpermissive mouse cells but amounts to 10- or 20-fold in the permissive monkey cells or the semipermissive human cells, respectively.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a disease consisting of both genetic and epigenetic changes. Although increasing evidence demonstrates that tumour progression entails chromatin-mediated changes such as DNA methylation, the role of histone variants in cancer initiation and progression currently remains unclear. Histone variants replace conventional histones within the nucleosome and confer unique biological functions to chromatin. Here we report that the histone variant macroH2A (mH2A) suppresses tumour progression of malignant melanoma. Loss of mH2A isoforms, histone variants generally associated with condensed chromatin and fine-tuning of developmental gene expression programs, is positively correlated with increasing malignant phenotype of melanoma cells in culture and human tissue samples. Knockdown of mH2A isoforms in melanoma cells of low malignancy results in significantly increased proliferation and migration in vitro and growth and metastasis in vivo. Restored expression of mH2A isoforms rescues these malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that the tumour-promoting function of mH2A loss is mediated, at least in part, through direct transcriptional upregulation of CDK8. Suppression of CDK8, a colorectal cancer oncogene, inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells, and knockdown of CDK8 in cells depleted of mH2A suppresses the proliferative advantage induced by mH2A loss. Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between mH2A and CDK8 expression levels exists in melanoma patient samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mH2A is a critical component of chromatin that suppresses the development of malignant melanoma, a highly intractable cutaneous neoplasm.},

The expression of the genes for each of the five histone proteins is tightly regulated with respect to the cell cycle, the developmental stage, and the expression of the other histone genes. In several species studied, the synthesis of all five proteins occurs exclusively in concert with the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle (Robbins and Borun 1967; Kedes et al. 1969; Perry and Kelley 1973); the four histones of the nucleosome core are found in equimolar amounts, whereas H1 protein is found in less than molar quantity (for review, see Kornberg 1974). Variant histone proteins associated with specific developmental stages have been observed (Cohen et al. 1975; Arceci et al. 1976; Newrock and Cohen, this volume), indicating that there must be genes for these variant proteins which are differentially expressed according to precise developmental programs. Drosophila melanogaster is an appealing organism in which to study these genes and...},

  abstract = {In the Timaeus Plato presents an elaborately wroughtaccount of the formation of the universe. Plato is deeply impressedwith the order and beauty he observes in the universe, and his projectin the dialogue is to explain that order and beauty. The universe, heproposes, is the product of rational, purposive, and beneficent agency.It is the handiwork of a divine Craftsman (``Demiurge,''d{\^e}miourgos, 28a6), who, imitating an unchanging andeternal model, imposes mathematical order on a preexistent chaos togenerate the ordered universe (kosmos). The governingexplanatory principle of the account is teleological: the universe as awhole as well as its various parts are so arranged as to produce a vastarray of good effects. It strikes Plato strongly that this arrangementis not fortuitous, but the outcome of the deliberate intent ofIntellect (nous), anthropomorphically represented by thefigure of the Craftsman who plans and constructs a world that is asexcellent as its nature permits it to be., As Plato tells it, the beautiful orderliness of the universe is notonly the manifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rationalsouls to understand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulationrestores those souls to their original state of excellence, a statethat was lost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethicaland religious dimension to the discourse., This picture of a divinely created universe, though controversialfrom the start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and admiration of numerous generationsof philosophers and theologians though the centuries.[1] Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as amonologue\textemdash{}by excluding exchanges between interlocutors thediscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set ofquestions to be investigated\textemdash{}the Timaeus was generallytaken to be the culmination of its author's intellectualachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayalof the universe. Not surprisingly, as after the Renaissance thetheological worldview gave way to a more secular one, the culturalinfluence of the Timaeus began to wane over time. In thelatter part of the nineteenth and earlier part of the twentiethcentury interest in the Timaeus was again stimulated by therefinement of philological methods and exact historical scholarship,[2] but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialoguewas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best andregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about thedevelopment of Plato's philosophy, but not much more. Recentdecades, however, have witnessed a revival of interest in theTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,and philologists, while not persuaded by the dialogue's boldclaims, have been fascinated by its majestic account and havesympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate its conceptualstructure.},

Here, we review the roots of this controversy in disparities between results derived from studies of chromatin in nuclei, chromatin isolated from nuclei, and chromatin reconstituted from defined components. Thanks to recent advances in imaging, modeling, and other approaches, it is now possible to recognize some unifying principles driving chromatin architecture at the level of the ubiquitous `30nm' chromatin fiber. These suggest that fiber architecture involves both zigzag and bent linker motifs, and that such heteromorphic structures facilitate the observed high packing ratios. Interactions between neighboring fibers in highly compact chromatin lead to extensive interdigitation of nucleosomes and the inability to resolve individual fibers in compact chromatin in situ.},

We crystallized the human CTCF DNA-binding domain in complex with a known CTCF-binding site. While ZF2 does not make sequence-specific contacts, each finger of ZF3\textendash{}7 contacts three bases of the 15-bp consensus sequence. Each conserved nucleotide makes base-specific hydrogen bonds with a particular residue. Most of the variable base pairs within the core sequence also engage in interactions with the protein. These interactions compensate for deviations from the consensus sequence, allowing CTCF to adapt to sequence variations. CTCF is sensitive to cytosine methylation at position 2, but insensitive at position 12 of the 15-bp core sequence. These differences can be rationalized structurally. Although included in crystallizations, ZF10 and ZF11 are not visible, while ZF8 and ZF9 span the backbone of the DNA duplex, conferring no sequence specificity but adding to overall binding stability.},

  abstract = {Background
Systems biologists work with many kinds of data, from many different sources, using a variety of software tools. Each of these tools typically excels at one type of analysis, such as of microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming) data resources and tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology data sets. A solution to this problem should recognize that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age of biology are constantly changing.

Results
In this paper we describe the Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software environment that helps to solve the problem of software and database integration. Guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended environment., We demonstrate that four simple data types (names, matrices, networks, and associative arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software. We highlight some capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools.

Conclusion
We have integrated diverse databases (for example, KEGG, BioCyc, String) and software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse software and databases the Gaggle enables simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA and protein abundance, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions), functional associations (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic pattern), metabolic pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed abstracts (STRING web resource), creating an exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy computational biologists, and those in between. The Gaggle uses Java RMI and Java Web Start technologies and can be found at .},

  abstract = {Leukaemias and other cancers possess a rare population of cells capable of the limitless self-renewal necessary for cancer initiation and maintenance. Eradication of these cancer stem cells is probably a critical part of any successful anti-cancer therapy, and may explain why conventional cancer therapies are often effective in reducing tumour burden, but are only rarely curative. Given that both normal and cancer stem cells are capable of self-renewal, the extent to which cancer stem cells resemble normal tissue stem cells is a critical issue if targeted therapies are to be developed. However, it remains unclear whether cancer stem cells must be phenotypically similar to normal tissue stem cells or whether they can retain the identity of committed progenitors. Here we show that leukaemia stem cells (LSC) can maintain the global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated programme. We isolated LSC from leukaemias initiated in committed granulocyte macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL-AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23). The LSC were capable of transferring leukaemia to secondary recipient mice when only four cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene expression profile very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal haematopoietic stem cells was re-activated in LSC. LSC can thus be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukaemia self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Our findings define progression from normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that targeting a self-renewal programme expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most successful computational approaches for protein function prediction integrate multiple genomics and proteomics data sources to make inferences about the function of unknown proteins. The most accurate of these algorithms have long running times, making them unsuitable for real-time protein function prediction in large genomes. As a result, the predictions of these algorithms are stored in static databases that can easily become outdated. We propose a new algorithm, GeneMANIA, that is as accurate as the leading methods, while capable of predicting protein function in real-time.
RESULTS: We use a fast heuristic algorithm, derived from ridge regression, to integrate multiple functional association networks and predict gene function from a single process-specific network using label propagation. Our algorithm is efficient enough to be deployed on a modern webserver and is as accurate as, or more so than, the leading methods on the MouseFunc I benchmark and a new yeast function prediction benchmark; it is robust to redundant and irrelevant data and requires, on average, less than ten seconds of computation time on tasks from these benchmarks.
CONCLUSION: GeneMANIA is fast enough to predict gene function on-the-fly while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. A prototype version of a GeneMANIA-based webserver is available at http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/prototype.},

  abstract = {Molecular Cloning has served as the foundation of technical expertise in labs worldwide for 30 years. No other manual has been so popular, or so influential. Molecular Cloning, Fourth Edition, by the celebrated founding author Joe Sambrook and new co-author, the distinguished HHMI investigator Michael Green, preserves the highly praised detail and clarity of previous editions and includes specific chapters and protocols commissioned for the book from expert practitioners at Yale, U Mass, Rockefeller University, Texas Tech, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Washington University, and other leading institutions. The theoretical and historical underpinnings of techniques are prominent features of the presentation throughout, information that does much to help trouble-shoot experimental problems. For the fourth edition of this classic work, the content has been entirely recast to include nucleic-acid based methods selected as the most widely used and valuable in molecular and cellular biology laboratories. Core chapters from the third edition have been revised to feature current strategies and approaches to the preparation and cloning of nucleic acids, gene transfer, and expression analysis. They are augmented by 12 new chapters which show how DNA, RNA, and proteins should be prepared, evaluated, and manipulated, and how data generation and analysis can be handled. The new content includes methods for studying interactions between cellular components, such as microarrays, next-generation sequencing technologies, RNA interference, and epigenetic analysis using DNA methylation techniques and chromatin immunoprecipitation. To make sense of the wealth of data produced by these techniques, a bioinformatics chapter describes the use of analytical tools for comparing sequences of genes and proteins and identifying common expression patterns among sets of genes.  Please take a look at our book preview site at molecularcloning.com. Building on thirty years of trust, reliability, and authority, the fourth edition of Molecular Cloning is the new gold standard--the one indispensable molecular biology laboratory manual and reference source.},

Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

  abstract = {Self-renewal is a hallmark of stem cells and cancer, but existence of a shared stemness program remains controversial. Here we construct a gene module map to systematically relate transcriptional programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult tissue stem cells, and human cancers. This map reveals two predominant gene modules that distinguish ESCs and adult tissue stem cells. The ESC-like transcriptional program is activated in diverse human epithelial cancers and strongly predicts metastasis and death. c-Myc, but not other oncogenes, is sufficient to reactivate the ESC-like program in normal and cancer cells. In primary human keratinocytes transformed by Ras and I$\kappa$B$\alpha$, c-Myc increases the fraction of tumor-initiating cells by 150-fold, enabling tumor formation and serial propagation with as few as 500 cells. c-Myc-enhanced tumor initiation is cell-autonomous and independent of genomic instability. Thus, activation of an ESC-like transcriptional program in differentiated adult cells may induce pathologic self-renewal characteristic of cancer stem cells.},

  abstract = {DNA microarrays are widely used to study changes in gene expression in tumors, but such studies are typically system-specific and do not address the commonalities and variations between different types of tumor. Here we present an integrated analysis of 1,975 published microarrays spanning 22 tumor types. We describe expression profiles in different tumors in terms of the behavior of modules, sets of genes that act in concert to carry out a specific function. Using a simple unified analysis, we extract modules and characterize gene-expression profiles in tumors as a combination of activated and deactivated modules. Activation of some modules is specific to particular types of tumor; for example, a growth-inhibitory module is specifically repressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and may underlie the deregulated proliferation in these cancers. Other modules are shared across a diverse set of clinical conditions, suggestive of common tumor progression mechanisms. For example, the bone osteoblastic module spans a variety of tumor types and includes both secreted growth factors and their receptors. Our findings suggest that there is a single mechanism for both primary tumor proliferation and metastasis to bone. Our analysis presents multiple research directions for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic studies.},

  abstract = {Cancer cells possess traits reminiscent of those ascribed to normal stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem (ES) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. Strikingly, histologically poorly differentiated tumors display preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in ES cells, combined with underexpression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, expression of activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc is observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers this ES-like signature is associated with high-grade ER-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The ES signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of ES-associated transcription regulators that are preferentially expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a novel link between genes associated with ES cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors, and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes displayed by many tumors.},

We developed a systems-level approach that integrates transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-Seq), proteomics, phenotype and biochemical studies of relatively unexplored basal fungi. Anaerobic gut fungi isolated from herbivores produce a large array of biomass-degrading enzymes that synergistically degrade crude, untreated plant biomass, and are competitive with optimized commercial preparations from Aspergillus and Trichoderma. Compared to these model platforms, gut fungal enzymes are unbiased in substrate preference due to a wealth of xylan-degrading enzymes. These enzymes are universally catabolite repressed, and are further regulated by a rich landscape of noncoding regulatory RNAs. Additionally, we identified several promising sequence-divergent enzyme candidates for lignocellulosic bioprocessing.},

  abstract = {The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuel ethanol typically involves a disruptive pretreatment process followed by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the cellulose and hemicellulose components to fermentable sugars. Attempts to improve process economics include protein engineering of cellulases, xylanases and related hydrolases to improve their specific activity or stability. However, it is recognized that enzyme performance is reduced during lignocellulose hydrolysis by interaction with lignin or lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC), so the selection or engineering of enzymes with reduced lignin interaction offers an alternative means of enzyme improvement. This study examines the inhibition of seven cellulase preparations, three xylanase preparations and a beta-glucosidase preparation by two purified, particulate lignin preparations derived from softwood using an organosolv pretreatment process followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. The two lignin preparations had similar particle sizes and surface areas but differed significantly in other physical properties and in their chemical compositions determined by a 2D correlation HSQC NMR technique and quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. The various cellulases differed by up to 3.5-fold in their inhibition by lignin, while the xylanases showed less variability ($<$ or = 1.7-fold). Of all the enzymes tested, beta-glucosidase was least affected by lignin.},

  abstract = {The anaerobic gut fungi occupy a unique niche in the intestinal tract of large herbivorous animals and are thought to act as primary colonizers of plant material during digestion. They are the only known obligately anaerobic fungi but molecular analysis of this group has been hampered by difficulties in their culture and manipulation, and by their extremely high A+T nucleotide content. This study begins to answer some of the fundamental questions about the structure and organization of the anaerobic gut fungal genome. Directed plasmid libraries using genomic DNA digested with highly or moderately rich AT-specific restriction enzymes (VspI and EcoRI) were prepared from a polycentric Orpinomyces isolate. Clones were sequenced from these libraries and the breadth of genomic inserts, both genic and intergenic, was characterized. Genes encoding numerous functions not previously characterized for these fungi were identified, including cytoskeletal, secretory pathway and transporter genes. A peptidase gene with no introns and having sequence similarity to a gene encoding a bacterial peptidase was also identified, extending the range of metabolic enzymes resulting from apparent trans-kingdom transfer from bacteria to fungi, as previously characterized largely for genes encoding plant-degrading enzymes. This paper presents the first thorough analysis of the genic, intergenic and rDNA regions of a variety of genomic segments from an anaerobic gut fungus and provides observations on rules governing intron boundaries, the codon biases observed with different types of genes, and the sequence of only the second anaerobic gut fungal promoter reported. Large numbers of retrotransposon sequences of different types were found and the authors speculate on the possible consequences of any such transposon activity in the genome. The coding sequences identified included several orphan gene sequences, including one with regions strongly suggestive of structural proteins such as collagens and lampirin. This gene was present as a single copy in Orpinomyces, was expressed during vegetative growth and was also detected in genomes from another gut fungal genus, Neocallimastix.},

The zoospores showed taxis towards the tissues surrounding the inflorescence of Lolium perenne L. in the rumen, invading principally the stomata and damaged tissues. The zoospores germinated on this substratum and the rhizoids of the developing vegetative stage penetrated the tissue, taking up 14C from labelled plant material, which was incorporated into the fungal cells. The conditions for maximum flagellate production (39$\cdot$C, pH 6$\cdot$0 to 7$\cdot$0, high concentration of CO2, absence of O2) resembled those found in the rumen. The organism was cultured in an undefined medium in vitro in the absence of other flagellates.},

  abstract = {Anaerobic gut fungi represent a distinct early-branching fungal phylum (Neocallimastigomycota) and reside in the rumen, hindgut, and feces of ruminant and nonruminant herbivores. The genome of an anaerobic fungal isolate, Orpinomyces sp. strain C1A, was sequenced using a combination of Illumina and PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technologies. The large genome (100.95 Mb, 16,347 genes) displayed extremely low G+C content (17.0\%), large noncoding intergenic regions (73.1\%), proliferation of microsatellite repeats (4.9\%), and multiple gene duplications. Comparative genomic analysis identified multiple genes and pathways that are absent in Dikarya genomes but present in early-branching fungal lineages and/or nonfungal Opisthokonta. These included genes for posttranslational fucosylation, the production of specific intramembrane proteases and extracellular protease inhibitors, the formation of a complete axoneme and intraflagellar trafficking machinery, and a near-complete focal adhesion machinery. Analysis of the lignocellulolytic machinery in the C1A genome revealed an extremely rich repertoire, with evidence of horizontal gene acquisition from multiple bacterial lineages. Experimental analysis indicated that strain C1A is a remarkable biomass degrader, capable of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions in multiple untreated grasses and crop residues examined, with the process significantly enhanced by mild pretreatments. This capability, acquired during its separate evolutionary trajectory in the rumen, along with its resilience and invasiveness compared to prokaryotic anaerobes, renders anaerobic fungi promising agents for consolidated bioprocessing schemes in biofuels production.},

  abstract = {Anaerobic gut fungi are an early branching family of fungi that are commonly found in the digestive tract of ruminants and monogastric herbivores. It is becoming increasingly clear that they are the primary colonizers of ingested plant biomass, and that they significantly contribute to the decomposition of plant biomass into fermentable sugars. As such, anaerobic fungi harbor a rich reservoir of undiscovered cellulolytic enzymes and enzyme complexes that can potentially transform the conversion of lignocellulose into bioenergy products. Despite their unique evolutionary history and cellulolytic activity, few species have been isolated and studied in great detail. As a result, their life cycle, cellular physiology, genetics, and cellulolytic metabolism remain poorly understood compared to aerobic fungi. To help address this limitation, this review briefly summarizes the current body of knowledge pertaining to anaerobic fungal biology, and describes progress made in the isolation, cultivation, molecular characterization, and long-term preservation of these microbes. We also discuss recent cellulase- and cellulosome-discovery efforts from gut fungi, and how these interesting, non-model microbes could be further adapted for biotechnology applications. Biotechnol.

  abstract = {Invasive species pose a serious threat to native plant communities and are an important contributor to loss of biodiversity. In the case of Phalaris arundinacea, L. (Poaceae), reed canary grass, a cool-season, long-lived perennial plant native to Eurasia and North America, nonnative agronomically important genotypes were introduced to North America for numerous uses such as forage and soil stabilization. Following repeated introductions, reed canary grass became an aggressive invader that takes over natural wet prairies, stream-banks and wetlands. Reed canary grass can outcompete native plant species, resulting in monospecific stands with concomitant loss of plant and insect diversity and ultimately to alteration in ecosystem function. Abiotic factors such as disturbance, changes in hydrological regime, and particularly nutrient runoff to wetlands can enhance reed canary grass establishment and vegetative spread. In addition, the species' capacity for early season growth, rapid vegetative spread, high stem elongation potential, wide physiological tolerance, and high architectural plasticity make the species highly aggressive under a wide range of ecological conditions. The change in life-history and environmental conditions responsible for the enhanced aggressiveness observed between native and invasive genotypes are not yet understood. Hence, reed canary grass provides an ideal study system to test a number of ecological and genetic hypotheses to explain why some plant species become extremely aggressive when transported into a new geographical area. To date, genetic studies have found that invasive populations have high genetic diversity and that genotypes differ in their phenotypic plasticity and response to ecological conditions, which may contribute to their invasion success. Finally comparative studies currently underway on European native and American invasive genotypes of reed canary grass should shed light on the mechanisms responsible for reed canary grass's aggressiveness and should provide an experimental protocol to test ecological and genetic hypotheses about what makes a species invasive.},

Here we describe the first three-dimensional structure of a fungal dockerin, the N-terminal dockerin of Cel45A from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces equi. The structure contains a novel fold of 42 residues. The ligand binding site consists of residues Trp 35, Tyr 8 and Asp 23, which are conserved in all fungal dockerins. The binding site is on the opposite side of the N- and C-termini of the molecule, implying that tandem dockerin domains, seen in the majority of anaerobic fungal plant cell wall degrading enzymes, could present multiple simultaneous binding sites and, therefore, permit tailoring of binding to catalytic demands.},

  abstract = {Plant cell walls represent an abundant, renewable source of biofuel and other useful products. The major bottleneck for the industrial scale-up of their conversion to simple sugars (saccharification), to be subsequently converted by microorganisms into ethanol or other products, is their recalcitrance to enzymatic saccharification. We investigated whether the structure of pectin that embeds the cellulose-hemicellulose network affects the exposure of cellulose to enzymes and consequently the process of saccharification. Reduction of de-methyl-esterified homogalacturonan (HGA) in Arabidopsis plants through the expression of a fungal polygalacturonase (PG) or an inhibitor of pectin methylesterase (PMEI) increased the efficiency of enzymatic saccharification. The improved enzymatic saccharification efficiency observed in transformed plants could also reduce the need for acid pretreatment. Similar results were obtained in PG-expressing tobacco plants and in PMEI-expressing wheat plants, indicating that reduction of de-methyl-esterified HGA may be used in crop species to facilitate the process of biomass saccharification.},

The sequence coverages and average peak intensities obtained from a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis are compared. Results show that methods using an acetonitrile extraction or digest times greater than the standard 4~h give no significant increase in peptide sequence coverage for automated digestion of low protein level samples. It is also shown that digests from SYPRO Ruby-stained gels show a greater improvement upon ZipTip cleanup than digests from Coomassie colloidal blue-stained gels. The digests from SYPRO Ruby-stained gels are also shown to give a higher average peptide intensity if a method with minimal gel plug washing is used.},

However, the recent identification of a large number of putative antisense transcripts strengthens the view that antisense RNAs might affect a wider variety of processes than previously thought. Here we show that in the model organism Neurospora crassa entrainment of the circadian clock, which is critical for the correct temporal expression of genes and their products, is controlled partly by an antisense RNA arising from a clock component locus. In a wild-type strain, levels of antisense frequency (frq) transcripts cycle in antiphase to sense frq transcripts in the dark, and are inducible by light. In mutant strains in which the induction of antisense frq RNA by light is abolished, the time of the internal clock is delayed relative to the wild-type strain, and resetting of the clock by light is altered. These data provide an unexpected link between antisense RNA and circadian timing and provide a new example of a eukaryotic cellular process regulated by naturally occurring antisense RNA.},

An overview of these mechanisms and the description of specific NAT functions is provided to give context for a broader discussion of fungal NATs. Transcriptome analyses have revealed a large number of NATs in a divergent group of fungi. The timing of NAT expression suggests roles in core life functions, such as responding to the environment and sexual reproduction. The transcriptome studies also uncover a large number of NATs whose functions remain elusive. These could provide novel control of gene expression, targeted responses to stimuli, or other functions.

Recent genomic analysis indicates that some plant pathogenic fungi are likely a largely untapped resource in which to prospect for novel hydrolytic enzymes for biomass conversion. In order to develop high throughput screening assays for enzyme bioprospecting, a standardized microplate assay was developed for rapid analysis of polysaccharide hydrolysis by fungal extracts, incorporating biomass substrates. Fungi were grown for 10 days on cellulose- or switchgrass-containing media to produce enzyme extracts for analysis. Reducing sugar released from filter paper, Avicel, corn stalk, switchgrass, carboxymethylcellulose, and arabinoxylan was quantified using a miniaturized colorimetric assay based on 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid. Significant interactions were identified among fungal species, growth media composition, assay substrate, and temperature. Within a small sampling of plant pathogenic fungi, some extracts had crude activities comparable to or greater than T. reesei, particularly when assayed at lower temperatures and on biomass substrates. This microplate assay system should prove useful for high-throughput bioprospecting for new sources of novel enzymes for biofuel production. Biotechnol.

Partial steam hydrolysis of the agricultural byproducts increased the enzyme yield of the microorganism.

A maximal cellulose activity of 0.06 IU/ml was observed. The enzyme was partially purified from the culture medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation exchange filtration. A 55-fold purification was achieved, with the purified xylanase having a specific activity of about 50 IU/mg protein. The molecular weight of the enzyme is about 22 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The optimal pH and temperature values of the enzyme were about 4.5 and 55$^\circ$C, respectively.

However, many features of non-model microbes, such as an anaerobic lifestyle and rigid cell wall, present formidable challenges to creating strain repositories and extracting high quality genomic DNA. Here, we establish accessible, high efficiency, and robust techniques to store lignocellulolytic anaerobic gut fungi long term without specialized equipment. Using glycerol as a cryoprotectant, gut fungal isolates were preserved for a minimum of 23~months at~-80~$^\circ$C. Unlike previously reported approaches, this improved protocol is non-toxic and rapid, with samples surviving twice as long with negligible growth impact. Genomic DNA extraction for these isolates was optimized to yield samples compatible with next generation sequencing platforms (e.g. Illumina, PacBio). Popular DNA isolation kits and precipitation protocols yielded preps that were unsuitable for sequencing due to carbohydrate contaminants from the chitin-rich cell wall and extensive energy reserves of gut fungi. To address this, we identified a proprietary method optimized for hardy plant samples that rapidly yielded DNA fragments in excess of 10~kb with minimal RNA, protein or carbohydrate contamination. Collectively, these techniques serve as fundamental tools to manipulate powerful biomass-degrading gut fungi and improve their accessibility among researchers.},

By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

  abstract = {Functional genomics technologies have been widely adopted in the biological research of both model and non-model species. An efficient functional annotation of DNA or protein sequences is a major requirement for the successful application of these approaches as functional information on gene products is often the key to the interpretation of experimental results. Therefore, there is an increasing need for bioinformatics resources which are able to cope with large amount of sequence data, produce valuable annotation results and are easily accessible to laboratories where functional genomics projects are being undertaken. We present the Blast2GO suite as an integrated and biologist-oriented solution for the high-throughput and automatic functional annotation of DNA or protein sequences based on the Gene Ontology vocabulary. The most outstanding Blast2GO features are: (i) the combination of various annotation strategies and tools controlling type and intensity of annotation, (ii) the numerous graphical features such as the interactive GO-graph visualization for gene-set function profiling or descriptive charts, (iii) the general sequence management features and (iv) high-throughput capabilities. We used the Blast2GO framework to carry out a detailed analysis of annotation behaviour through homology transfer and its impact in functional genomics research. Our aim is to offer biologists useful information to take into account when addressing the task of functionally characterizing their sequence data.},

OrthoMCL software was used to cluster proteins based on sequence similarity, using an all-against-all BLAST search of each species' proteome, followed by normalization of inter-species differences, and Markov clustering. A total of 511\,797 proteins (81.6\% of the total dataset) were clustered into 70\,388 ortholog groups. The ortholog database may be queried based on protein or group accession numbers, keyword descriptions or BLAST similarity. Ortholog groups exhibiting specific phyletic patterns may also be identified, using either a graphical interface or a text-based Phyletic Pattern Expression grammar. Information for ortholog groups includes the phyletic profile, the list of member proteins and a multiple sequence alignment, a statistical summary and graphical view of similarities, and a graphical representation of domain architecture. OrthoMCL software, the entire FASTA dataset employed and clustering results are available for download.

In principle, the technique is similar to other in vitro digestibility procedures using ground particulate substrates, anaerobic media and a rumen fluid inoculum. It differs, however, in that incubations are conducted in gas-tight culture bottles, thus enabling gases to accumulate in the head-space as the fermentation proceeds. A pressure transducer connected to a digital readout voltmeter and gas-tight syringe assembly is then used to measure and release the accumulated gas pressures from the incubating culture bottles. By repeating this gas-measurement, gas-release procedure at regular intervals during the fermentation, it is possible to construct gas accumulation profiles for feeds by summation of regression-corrected gas volumes. These profiles are then described using a recently derived growth function developed to characterise gas production profiles. Results obtained establish the pressure transducer as a suitable tool for determining the fermentation kinetics of ruminant feeds and ranking them with respect to their in vitro fermentability.},

These studies have laid the groundwork for unraveling new enzymatic strategies for deconstructing the plant cell wall, including the discovery of polysaccharide monooxygenases that enhance the activity of cellulases. The identification of genes encoding proteins lacking functional annotation, but that are coregulated with cellulolytic genes, suggests functions associated with plant biomass degradation remain to be elucidated. Recent research shows that signaling cascades mediating cellulolytic responses often act in a light-dependent manner and show crosstalk with other metabolic pathways.

Imp2-/- mice are highly resistant to diet-induced obesity and fatty liver and display superior glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, increased energy expenditure and better defense of core temperature on cold exposure. Imp2-/- brown fat and Imp2-/- brown adipocytes differentiated in vitro contain more UCP1 polypeptide than Imp2+/+ despite similar levels of Ucp1 mRNA; the Imp2-/- adipocytes also exhibit greater uncoupled oxygen consumption. IMP2 binds the mRNAs encoding Ucp1 and other mitochondrial components, and most exhibit increased translational efficiency in the absence of IMP2. In vitro IMP2 inhibits translation of mRNAs bearing the Ucp1 untranslated segments. Thus IMP2 limits longevity and regulates nutrient and energy metabolism in the mouse by controlling the translation of its client mRNAs.,},

  abstract = {Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) is a 140 kDa zinc finger protein that robustly induces brown fat determination and differentiation. Recent data suggests that brown fat cells arise in vivo from a Myf5-positive, myoblastic lineage by the action of PRDM16 (ref. 3); however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this developmental switch is unclear. Here we show that PRDM16 forms a transcriptional complex with the active form of C/EBP-$\beta$ (also known as LAP), acting as a critical molecular unit that controls the cell fate switch from myoblastic precursors to brown fat cells. Forced expression of PRDM16 and C/EBP-$\beta$ is sufficient to induce a fully functional brown fat program in naive fibroblastic cells, including skin fibroblasts from mouse and man. Transplantation of fibroblasts expressing these two factors into mice gives rise to an ectopic fat pad with the morphological and biochemical characteristics of brown fat. Like endogenous brown fat, this synthetic brown fat tissue acts as a sink for glucose uptake, as determined by positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose. These data indicate that the PRDM16\textendash{}C/EBP-$\beta$ complex initiates brown fat formation from myoblastic precursors, and may provide opportunities for the development of new therapeutics for obesity and type-2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {Variants in the IMP2 (insulin-like growth factor 2 [IGF2] mRNA-binding protein 2) gene are implicated in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. We describe the ability of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to regulate the cap-independent translation of IGF2 mRNA through phosphorylation of IMP2, an oncofetal RNA-binding protein. IMP2 is doubly phosphorylated in a rapamycin-inhibitable, amino acid-dependent manner in cells and by mTOR in vitro. Double phosphorylation promotes IMP2 binding to the IGF2 leader 3 mRNA 5${'}$ untranslated region, and the translational initiation of this mRNA through eIF-4E- and 5${'}$ cap-independent internal ribosomal entry. Unexpectedly, the interaction of IMP2 with mTOR complex 1 occurs through mTOR itself rather than through raptor. Whereas depletion of mTOR strongly inhibits IMP2 phosphorylation in cells, comparable depletion of raptor has no effect; moreover, the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate IMP2 in vitro is unaffected by the elimination of raptor. Dual phosphorylation of IMP2 at the mTOR sites is evident in the mouse embryo, likely coupling nutrient sufficiency to IGF2 expression and fetal growth. Doubly phosphorylated IMP2 is also widely expressed in adult tissues, including islets of Langerhans.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Upon activation by long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), UCP1 increases the conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to make BAT mitochondria generate heat rather than ATP. Despite being a member of the family of mitochondrial anion carriers (SLC25), UCP1 is believed to transport H+ by an unusual mechanism that has long remained unresolved. Here, we achieved direct patch-clamp measurements of UCP1 currents from the IMM of BAT mitochondria. We show that UCP1 is an LCFA anion/H+ symporter. However, the LCFA anions cannot dissociate from UCP1 due to hydrophobic interactions established by their hydrophobic tails, and UCP1 effectively operates as an H+ carrier activated by LCFA. A similar LCFA-dependent mechanism of transmembrane H+ transport may be employed by other SLC25 members and be responsible for mitochondrial uncoupling and regulation of metabolic efficiency in various tissues.},

Janiszewska et al. find that IMP2 binds several mRNAs encoding mitochondria respiratory chain complex subunits and show that gliomaspheres, a model for cancer stem cells, sustain their high oxidative phosphorylation function by IMP2 expression., Growth of numerous cancer types is believed to be driven by a subpopulation of poorly differentiated cells, often referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs), that have the capacity for self-renewal, tumor initiation, and generation of nontumorigenic progeny. Despite their potentially key role in tumor establishment and maintenance, the energy requirements of these cells and the mechanisms that regulate their energy production are unknown. Here, we show that the oncofetal insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IMP2, IGF2BP2) regulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in primary glioblastoma (GBM) sphere cultures (gliomaspheres), an established in vitro model for CSC expansion. We demonstrate that IMP2 binds several mRNAs that encode mitochondrial respiratory chain complex subunits and that it interacts with complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) proteins. Depletion of IMP2 in gliomaspheres decreases their oxygen consumption rate and both complex I and complex IV activity that results in impaired clonogenicity in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Importantly, inhibition of OXPHOS but not of glycolysis abolishes GBM cell clonogenicity. Our observations suggest that gliomaspheres depend on OXPHOS for their energy production and survival and that IMP2 expression provides a key mechanism to ensure OXPHOS maintenance by delivering respiratory chain subunit-encoding mRNAs to mitochondria and contributing to complex I and complex IV assembly.},

However, whether inhibition of mTOR signalling can extend life in a mammalian species was unknown. We report here that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, extends median and maximal lifespan of both male and female mice when fed beginning at 600 days of age. Based on age at 90\% mortality, rapamycin led to an increase of 14\% for females and 9\% for males. The effect was seen at three independent test sites in genetically heterogeneous mice, chosen to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease susceptibility. Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did not differ from those of control mice. In a separate study, rapamycin fed to mice beginning at 270 days of age also increased survival in both males and females, based on an interim analysis conducted near the median survival point. Rapamycin may extend lifespan by postponing death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms of ageing, or both. These are the first results to demonstrate a role for mTOR signalling in the regulation of mammalian lifespan, as well as pharmacological extension of lifespan in both genders. These findings have implications for further development of interventions targeting mTOR for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases.},

The IGF-II gene generates multiple mRNAs with different 5${'}$ untranslated regions (5${'}$ UTRs) that are translated in a differential manner during development.

IMPs contain the unique combination of two RNA recognition motifs and four hnRNP K homology domains and are homologous to the Xenopus Vera and chicken zipcode-binding proteins. IMP localizes to subcytoplasmic domains in a growth-dependent and cell-specific manner and causes a dose-dependent translational repression of IGF-II leader 3 \textendash{}luciferase mRNA. Mouse IMPs are produced in a burst at embryonic day 12.5 followed by a decline towards birth, and, similar to IGF-II, IMPs are especially expressed in developing epithelia, muscle, and placenta in both mouse and human embryos.

Changes in gene expression in pancreatic beta-cells from type 2 diabetes (T2D) should provide insights into their abnormal insulin secretion and turnover.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Frozen sections were obtained from cadaver pancreases of 10 control and 10 T2D human subjects. Beta-cell enriched samples were obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM). RNA was extracted, amplified and subjected to microarray analysis. Further analysis was performed with DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. There were changes in expression of genes linked to glucotoxicity. Evidence of oxidative stress was provided by upregulation of several metallothionein genes. There were few changes in the major genes associated with cell cycle, apoptosis or endoplasmic reticulum stress. There was differential expression of genes associated with pancreatic regeneration, most notably upregulation of members of the regenerating islet gene (REG) family and metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7). Some of the genes found in GWAS studies to be related to T2D were also found to be differentially expressed. IGF2BP2, TSPAN8, and HNF1B (TCF2) were upregulated while JAZF1 and SLC30A8 were downregulated.

Conclusions/Significance
This study made possible by LCM has identified many novel changes in gene expression that enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D.},

We genotyped 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 717 individuals from 146 families phenotyped by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) with minimal model analysis, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for percent body fat. Three SNPs and one SNP combination that captured the majority of the variation in the region were tested for association with T2DM-related quantitative traits using a variance components framework. After correction for multiple testing, rs11705701 showed association with percent body fat (PACT = 0.041) with body fat decreasing $\sim$1.5\textendash{}2\% per copy of the A allele. We next tested whether the interaction between rs11705701 and body fat was associated with T2DM-relative quantitative traits. rs11705701 was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity (Bonferroni P = 0.028) and marginally associated with OGTT 2-h insulin (Bonferroni P = 0.066) and disposition index (DI) (Bonferroni P = 0.072). We conclude that rs11705701 in IGF2BP2 is associated with body fat and this effect on body fat influences insulin resistance which may contribute to T2DM risk.},

Sixteen young healthy male subjects were recruited for this study. Subjects completed a graded exercise test to determine maximal oxygen uptake () and muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis. Mitochondrial content was determined using transmission electron microscopy imaging and OXPHOS was determined as the maximal coupled respiration in permeabilized fibres. Biomarkers of interest were citrate synthase (CS) activity, cardiolipin content, mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA), complex I\textendash{}V protein content, and complex I\textendash{}IV activity. Spearman correlation coefficient tests and Lin's concordance tests were applied to assess the absolute and relative association between the markers and mitochondrial content or OXPHOS. Subjects had a large range of  (range 29.9\textendash{}71.6 ml min-1 kg-1) and mitochondrial content (4\textendash{}15\% of cell volume). Cardiolipin content showed the strongest association with mitochondrial content followed by CS and complex I activities. mtDNA was not related to mitochondrial content. Complex IV activity showed the strongest association with muscle oxidative capacity followed by complex II activity. We conclude that cardiolipin content, and CS and complex I activities are the biomarkers that exhibit the strongest association with mitochondrial content, while complex IV activity is strongly associated with OXPHOS capacity in human skeletal muscle.},

The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups., Results The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin., Conclusions Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk.

  abstract = {Over the last two centuries, there has been a significant increase in average lifespan expectancy in the developed world. One unambiguous clinical implication of getting older is the risk of experiencing age-related diseases including various cancers, dementia, type-2 diabetes, cataracts and osteoporosis. Historically, the ageing process and its consequences were thought to be intractable. However, over the last two decades or so, a wealth of empirical data has been generated which demonstrates that longevity in model organisms can be extended through the manipulation of individual genes. In particular, many pathological conditions associated with the ageing process in model organisms, and importantly conserved from nematodes to humans, are attenuated in long-lived genetic mutants. For example, several long-lived genetic mouse models show attenuation in age-related cognitive decline, adiposity, cancer and glucose intolerance. Therefore, these long-lived mice enjoy a longer period without suffering the various sequelae of ageing. The greatest challenge in the biology of ageing is to now identify the mechanisms underlying increased healthy lifespan in these model organisms. Given that the elderly are making up an increasingly greater proportion of society, this focused approach in model organisms should help identify tractable interventions that can ultimately be translated to humans.},

We show in mice that deletion of the nutrient-responsive mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway component ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1) led to increased lifespan and resistance to age-related pathologies such as bone, immune and motor dysfunction and loss of insulin sensitivity. Deletion of S6K1 induced gene expression patterns similar to those seen in CR or with pharmacological activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved regulator of the metabolic response to CR. Our results demonstrate that S6K1 influences healthy mammalian lifespan, and suggest therapeutic manipulation of S6K1 and AMPK might mimic CR and provide broad protection against diseases of aging.},

We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk.

These animals demonstrate reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity and exhibit an approximate 20\% increase in median survival. While mTOR$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mice are smaller than wild type mice, these animals do not demonstrate any alterations in normalized food intake, glucose homeostasis or metabolic rate. Consistent with their increased lifespan, mTOR$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mice exhibited a reduction in a number of aging tissue biomarkers. Functional assessment suggested that as mTOR$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mice age, they exhibit a marked functional preservation in many but not all organ systems. Thus, in a mammalian model, while reducing mTOR expression markedly increases overall lifespan, it affects the age-dependent decline in tissue and organ function in a segmental fashion.},

  abstract = {This work identifies a novel pathway by which mTOR regulates growth upstream of fetal growth factor IGF2. Loss of IGF2 results in diminished embryonic growth. Dai et al. show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking RNA-binding protein IMP1 are defective in IGF2 mRNA splicing and translation. IMP1-deficient cells can be rescued by expression of IMP1 that is cotranslationally phosphorylated by mTORC2. These results uncover a mechanism by which mTORC2 controls organismal growth, independent of mTORC1., Lack of IGF2 in mice results in diminished embryonic growth due to diminished cell proliferation. Here we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the RNA-binding protein IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1) have defective splicing and translation of IGF2 mRNAs, markedly reduced IGF2 polypeptide production, and diminished proliferation. The proliferation of the IMP1-null fibroblasts can be restored to wild-type levels by IGF2 in vitro or by re-expression of IMP1, which corrects the defects in IGF2 RNA splicing and translation. The ability of IMP1 to correct these defects is dependent on IMP1 phosphorylation at Ser181, which is catalyzed cotranslationally by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Phosphorylation strongly enhances IMP1 binding to the IGF2-leader 3 5${'}$ untranslated region, which is absolutely required to enable IGF2-leader 3 mRNA translational initiation by internal ribosomal entry. These findings uncover a new mechanism by which mTOR regulates organismal growth by promoting IGF2 production in the mouse embryo through mTORC2-catalyzed cotranslational IMP1/IMP3 phosphorylation. Inasmuch as TORC2 is activated by association with ribosomes, the present results indicate that mTORC2-catalyzed cotranslational protein phosphorylation is a core function of this complex.},

In just the last two years, the use of transgenic mice, antisense RNA, and RNAi (RNA interference) techniques have contributed to our understanding of the roles of these proteins and how they interface with many diverse processes in cells. In this article, I will review the recent advances relating to VICKZ proteins and try to suggest a framework for understanding how, in conjunction with other RNA-binding proteins, they participate in a combinatorial fashion to help determine the fate of their RNA targets and, ultimately, the function of cells in which they are expressed. Such a 'post-transcriptional operon' model, as proposed by Keene and Tenenbaum [(2002) Mol.

  issn = {0006-3002},
  abstract = {Cells have complex membranous organelles for the compartmentalization and the regulation of most intracellular processes. Organelle biogenesis and maintenance requires newly synthesized proteins, each of which needs to go from the ribosome translating its mRNA to the correct membrane for insertion or transclocation to an a organellar subcompartment. Decades of research have revealed how proteins are targeted to the correct organelle and translocated across one or more organelle membranes ro the compartment where they function. The paradigm examples involve interactions between a peptide sequence in the protein, localization factors, and various membrane embedded translocation machineries. Membrane translocation is either cotranslational or posttranslational depending on the protein and target organelle. Meanwhile research in embryos, neurons and yeast revealed an alternative targeting mechanism in which the mRNA is localized and only then translated to synthesize the protein in the correct location. In these cases, the targeting information is coded by the cis-acting sequences in the mRNA ("Zipcodes") that interact with localization factors and, in many cases, are transported by the molecular motors on the cytoskeletal filaments. Recently, evidence has been found for this "mRNA based" mechanism in organelle protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the photosynthetic membranes within chloroplasts. Here we review known and potential roles of mRNA localization in protein targeting to and within organelles.

Still, p62 transgenic livers do not show liver cell damage but exhibit a pronounced induction of Igf2 and activation of the downstream survival kinase AKT. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between p62 and IGF2 expression in the human system and to study potential antiapoptotic actions of p62. p62 and IGF2 mRNA levels were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. For knockdown and overexpression experiments, human hepatoma HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were transfected with siRNA or plasmid DNA. Phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2 were analyzed by Western blot. Investigations of 32 human HCC tissues showed a strong correlation between p62 and IGF2 expression. Of note, p62 expression was increased markedly in patients with poor outcome. In hepatoma cells overexpression of p62 lowered levels of doxorubicin-induced caspase-3-like activity. Vice versa, knockdown of p62 resulted in increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. However, neither PI3K inhibitors nor a neutralizing IGF2 antibody showed any effects. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in hepatoma cells overexpressing p62 and decreased levels in p62 knockdown experiments. When p62-overexpressing cells were treated with ERK1/2 inhibitors, the apoptosis-protecting effect of p62 was completely abrogated. Our data demonstrate that p62 exerts IGF2-independent antiapoptotic action, which is facilitated via phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Furthermore, p62 might serve as a new prognostic marker in HCC.},

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genome-wide association studies have recently identified novel type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene regions. We assessed the effects of six of these regions on insulin secretion as determined by a hyperglycaemic clamp.
METHODS: Variants of the HHEX/IDE, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2 and CDKN2A/CDKN2B genes were genotyped in a cohort of 146 participants with NGT and 126 with IGT from the Netherlands and Germany, who all underwent a hyperglycaemic clamp at 10 mmol/l glucose.
RESULTS: Variants of CDKAL1 and IGF2BP2 were associated with reductions in first-phase insulin secretion (34\% and 28\%, respectively). The disposition index was also significantly reduced. For gene regions near HHEX/IDE, SLC30A8 and CDKN2A/CDKN2B we did not find significant associations with first-phase insulin secretion (7-18\% difference between genotypes; all p $>$ 0.3). None of the variants showed a significant effect on second-phase insulin secretion in our cohorts (2-8\% difference between genotypes, all p $>$ 0.3). Furthermore, the gene variants were not associated with the insulin sensitivity index.
CONCLUSIONS: Variants of CDKAL1 and IGF2BP2 attenuate the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but show no effect on the second phase of insulin secretion. Our results, based on hyperglycaemic clamps, provide further insight into the pathogenic mechanism behind the association of these gene variants with type 2 diabetes.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with follow-up from 1976 to 1990.
SETTING: 11 U.S. states.
PARTICIPANTS: 114,281 female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years who did not have diagnosed diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer in 1976.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: 2204 cases of diabetes were diagnosed during 1.49 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, body mass index was the dominant predictor of risk for diabetes mellitus. Risk increased with greater body mass index, and even women with average weight (body mass index, 24.0 kg/m2) had an elevated risk. Compared with women with stable weight (those who gained or lost less than 5 kg between age 18 years and 1976) and after adjustment for age and body mass index at age 18 years, the relative risk for diabetes mellitus among women who had a weight gain of 5.0 to 7.9 kg was 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.3). The corresponding relative risk for women who gained 8.0 to 10.9 kg was 2.7 (CI, 2.1 to 3.3). In contrast, women who lost more than 5.0 kg reduced their risk for diabetes mellitus by 50\% or more. These results were independent of family history of diabetes.
CONCLUSION: The excess risk for diabetes with even modest and typical adult weight gain is substantial. These findings support the importance of maintaining a constant body weight throughout adult life and suggest that the 1990 U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines that allow a substantial weight gain after 35 years of age are misleading.},

  abstract = {Aging, which affects all organ systems, is one of the most complex phenotypes. Recent discoveries in long-lived mutant mice have revealed molecular mechanisms of longevity in mammals which may contribute to our understanding of why humans age. These mutations include naturally occurring spontaneous mutations, and those of mice genetically modified by modern genomic technologies. It is generally believed that the most fundamental mechanisms of aging are evolutionarily conserved across species. The following types of longevity mechanisms have been intensively studied: suppression of the somatotropic (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1) axis, decreased metabolism and increased resistance of oxidative stress, reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin sensitivity, and delayed reproductive maturation and reduced fertility. In addition, many of the mutations have a sex-dependent effect on lifespan, and when present in different genetic backgrounds, the effects of the same gene mutation can vary considerably. The present review discusses these phenotypic variations as well as describing the known longevity genes in long-lived mutant mice and the molecular mechanisms specifying longevity. We anticipate that these mouse studies will ultimately provide clues about how to delay the aging and prolong lifespan, and help to develop therapies for healthier human aging.},

  abstract = {Alterations in nonshivering thermogenesis are presently discussed as being both potentially causative of and able to counteract obesity. However, the necessity for mammals to defend their body temperature means that the ambient temperature profoundly affects the outcome and interpretation of metabolic experiments. An adequate understanding and assessment of nonshivering thermogenesis is therefore paramount for metabolic studies. Classical nonshivering thermogenesis is facultative, i.e. it is only activated when an animal acutely requires extra heat (switched on in minutes), and adaptive, i.e. it takes weeks for an increase in capacity to develop. Nonshivering thermogenesis is fully due to brown adipose tissue activity; adaptation corresponds to the recruitment of this tissue. Diet-induced thermogenesis is probably also facultative and adaptive and due to brown adipose tissue activity. Although all mammals respond to injected/infused norepinephrine (noradrenaline) with an increase in metabolism, in non-adapted mammals this increase mainly represents the response of organs not involved in nonshivering thermogenesis; only the increase after adaptation represents nonshivering thermogenesis. Thermogenesis (metabolism) should be expressed per animal, and not per body mass [not even to any power (0.75 or 0.66)]. A 'cold tolerance test' does not examine nonshivering thermogenesis capacity; rather it tests shivering capacity and endurance. For mice, normal animal house temperatures are markedly below thermoneutrality, and the mice therefore have a metabolic rate and food consumption about 1.5 times higher than their intrinsic requirements. Housing and examining mice at normal house temperatures carries a high risk of identifying false positives for intrinsic metabolic changes; in particular, mutations/treatments that affect the animal's insulation (fur, skin) may lead to such problems. Correspondingly, true alterations in intrinsic metabolic rate remain undetected when metabolism is examined at temperatures below thermoneutrality. Thus, experiments with animals kept and examined at thermoneutrality are likely to yield an improved possibility of identifying agents and genes important for human energy balance.},

  abstract = {The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled via a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.},

Treatment of mice with low doses of the protonophore 2,4-dinitrophenol promotes enhanced tissue respiratory rates, improved serological glucose, triglyceride and insulin levels, decrease of reactive oxygen species levels and tissue DNA and protein oxidation, as well as reduced body weight. Importantly, 2,4-dinitrophenol-treated animals also presented enhanced longevity. Our results demonstrate that mild mitochondrial uncoupling is a highly effective in vivo antioxidant strategy, and describe the first therapeutic intervention capable of effectively reproducing the physiological, metabolic and lifespan effects of caloric restriction in healthy mammals.},

The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.},

However, how ubiquitous expression of housekeeping genes is achieved has been less clear. In particular, it is unknown whether ubiquitously active enhancers exist and how developmental and housekeeping gene regulation is separated. An attractive hypothesis is that different core promoters might exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers. This is conceivable, as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions, including elements that are predominantly found at either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes. Here we show that thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and ovarian somatic cells (OSCs) exhibit a marked specificity to one of two core promoters\textemdash{}one derived from a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from a developmentally regulated transcription factor\textemdash{}and confirm the existence of these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition, we identify two transcription factors\textemdash{}Dref and Trl\textemdash{}that bind and activate housekeeping versus developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer\textendash{}core-promoter specificity that separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome.},

  abstract = {Cohesin complexes mediate sister-chromatid cohesion in dividing cells but may also contribute to gene regulation in postmitotic cells. How cohesin regulates gene expression is not known. Here we describe cohesin-binding sites in the human genome and show that most of these are associated with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a zinc-finger protein required for transcriptional insulation. CTCF is dispensable for cohesin loading onto DNA, but is needed to enrich cohesin at specific binding sites. Cohesin enables CTCF to insulate promoters from distant enhancers and controls transcription at the H19/IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) locus. This role of cohesin seems to be independent of its role in cohesion. We propose that cohesin functions as a transcriptional insulator, and speculate that subtle deficiencies in this function contribute to `cohesinopathies' such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome.},

  abstract = {The na{\"\i}ve pluripotent state has been shown in mice to lead to broad and more robust developmental potential relative to primed mouse epiblast cells. The human na{\"\i}ve ES cell state has eluded derivation without the use of transgenes, and forced expression of OCT4, KLF4, and KLF2 allows maintenance of human cells in a na{\"\i}ve state [Hanna J, et al. (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107(20):9222\textendash{}9227]. We describe two routes to generate nontransgenic na{\"\i}ve human ES cells (hESCs). The first is by reverse toggling of preexisting primed hESC lines by preculture in the histone deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, followed by culture in MEK/ERK and GSK3 inhibitors (2i) with FGF2. The second route is by direct derivation from a human embryo in 2i with FGF2. We show that human na{\"\i}ve cells meet mouse criteria for the na{\"\i}ve state by growth characteristics, antibody labeling profile, gene expression, X-inactivation profile, mitochondrial morphology, microRNA profile and development in the context of teratomas. hESCs can exist in a na{\"\i}ve state without the need for transgenes. Direct derivation is an elusive, but attainable, process, leading to cells at the earliest stage of in vitro pluripotency described for humans. Reverse toggling of primed cells to na{\"\i}ve is efficient and reproducible.},

  abstract = {CTCF is a ubiquitously expressed regulator of fundamental genomic processes including transcription, intra- and interchromosomal interactions, and chromatin structure. Because of its critical role in genome function, CTCF binding patterns have long been assumed to be largely invariant across different cellular environments. Here we analyze genome-wide occupancy patterns of CTCF by ChIP-seq in 19 diverse human cell types, including normal primary cells and immortal lines. We observed highly reproducible yet surprisingly plastic genomic binding landscapes, indicative of strong cell-selective regulation of CTCF occupancy. Comparison with massively parallel bisulfite sequencing data indicates that 41\% of variable CTCF binding is linked to differential DNA methylation, concentrated at two critical positions within the CTCF recognition sequence. Unexpectedly, CTCF binding patterns were markedly different in normal versus immortal cells, with the latter showing widespread disruption of CTCF binding associated with increased methylation. Strikingly, this disruption is accompanied by up-regulation of CTCF expression, with the result that both normal and immortal cells maintain the same average number of CTCF occupancy sites genome-wide. These results reveal a tight linkage between DNA methylation and the global occupancy patterns of a major sequence-specific regulatory factor.},

Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify \textasciitilde{}2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect \textasciitilde{}580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

  abstract = {To ensure proper gene regulation within constrained nuclear space, chromosomes facilitate access to transcribed regions, while compactly packaging all other information. Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization is important for genome function. Here, we show that very specific long-range interactions are anchored by cohesin/CTCF sites, but not cohesin-only or CTCF-only sites, to form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. These loops demarcate topological domains and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss of cohesin/CTCF contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes. Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programmes within them.

Such regulatory elements often bypass intervening genes and typically comprise binding sites for multiple transcription factors that can also be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to produce noncoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Genome-wide analyses have revealed chromatin signatures of enhancers, such as the enrichment for monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and the acetylation or methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). Enhancer signatures have been used to describe the transitions of these regulatory elements from inactive to primed and from activated to decommissioned states during development. New mutations of enhancer sequences and of the protein factors regulating enhancer function in human disease continue to be identified, contributing to a growing class of 'enhanceropathies'.},

  abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture approaches have shown that interphase chromatin is partitioned into spatially segregated Mb-sized compartments and sub-Mb-sized topological domains. This compartmentalization is thought to facilitate the matching of genes and regulatory elements, but its precise function and mechanistic basis remain unknown. Cohesin controls chromosome topology to enable DNA repair and chromosome segregation in cycling cells. In addition, cohesin associates with active enhancers and promoters and with CTCF to form long-range interactions important for gene regulation. Although these findings suggest an important role for cohesin in genome organization, this role has not been assessed on a global scale. Unexpectedly, we find that architectural compartments are maintained in noncycling mouse thymocytes after genetic depletion of cohesin in vivo. Cohesin was, however, required for specific long-range interactions within compartments where cohesin-regulated genes reside. Cohesin depletion diminished interactions between cohesin-bound sites, whereas alternative interactions between chromatin features associated with transcriptional activation and repression became more prominent, with corresponding changes in gene expression. Our findings indicate that cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression states within preexisting chromosomal compartments.},

Although its role in chromatid cohesion is well established, the functional significance of cohesin's association with interphase chromatin is not clear. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we show that the STAG1 (Scc3/SA1) subunit of cohesin interacts with the CCTC-binding factor CTCF bound to the c-myc insulator element. Both allele-specific binding of CTCF and Scc3/SA1 at the imprinted IGF2/H19 gene locus and our analyses of human DM1 alleles containing base substitutions at CTCF-binding motifs indicate that cohesin recruitment to chromosomal sites depends on the presence of CTCF. A large-scale genomic survey using ChIP-Chip demonstrates that Scc3/SA1 binding strongly correlates with the CTCF-binding site distribution in chromosomal arms. However, some chromosomal sites interact exclusively with CTCF, whereas others interact with Scc3/SA1 only. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy and ChIP-Chip experiments demonstrate that CTCF associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase. These results link cohesin to gene regulatory functions and suggest an essential role for CTCF during sister chromatid cohesion. These results have implications for the functional role of cohesin subunits in the pathogenesis of Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Roberts syndromes.},

This cohesion facilitates repair of damage that occurs during DNA replication, and, crucially, enforces faithful segregation of chromosomes upon cell division. Cohesin also influences gene expression, and relative to sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression is exquisitely sensitive to moderate changes in cohesin activity. Early studies revealed differences in cohesin's roles in gene expression between various organisms. In all organisms examined, however, cohesin marks a subset of active genes. This review focuses on the roles of cohesin at active genes, and to what extent these roles are conserved between organisms.},

  abstract = {Higher-order chromatin structure is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression. Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36\% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.},

  abstract = {The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term /`topological domains/', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

  abstract = {Genetic and epigenetic inheritance through mitosis is critical for dividing cells to maintain their state. This process occurs in the context of large-scale re-organization of chromosome conformation during prophase leading to the formation of mitotic chromosomes, and during the reformation of the interphase nucleus during telophase and early G1. This review highlights how recent studies over the last 5~years employing chromosome conformation capture combined with classical models of chromosome organization based on decades of microscopic observations, are providing new insights into the three-dimensional organization of chromatin inside the interphase nucleus and within mitotic chromosomes. One striking observation is that interphase genome organization displays cell type-specific features that are related to cell type-specific gene expression, whereas mitotic chromosome folding appears universal and tissue invariant. This raises the question of whether or not there is a need for an epigenetic memory for genome folding. Herein, the two different folding states of mammalian genomes are reviewed and then models are discussed wherein instructions for cell type-specific genome folding are locally encoded in the linear genome and transmitted through mitosis, e.g., as open chromatin sites with or without continuous binding of transcription factors. In the next cell cycle these instructions are used to re-assemble protein complexes on regulatory elements which then drive three-dimensional folding of the genome from the bottom up through local action and self-assembly into higher order levels of cell type-specific organization. In this model, no explicit epigenetic memory for cell type-specific chromosome folding is required.},

They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of CTCF in three cell types and identified significant binding of CTCF to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of CTCF-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking CTCF-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by CTCF. Our data indicate that CTCF may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the CTCF function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.},

Two and one-half days after transfection using the calcium phosphate technique, we extracted RNA from the entire cell population and analyzed it by the S1 nuclease hybridization assay. Transcripts were barely detectable when $\beta$-globin gene-plasmid recombinants were used. However, 200 times more $\beta$-globin gene transcripts were found when the $\beta$-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90\% of these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5${'}$ end as authentic rabbit globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of $\beta$-globin protein was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining. Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including 1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site of the rabbit $\beta$-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may be used for the regulation of gene expression.},

Despite advances in chemotherapy and radical surgery, most advanced stage ovarian cancer patients die from their disease, highlighting the need for the development of novel treatment strategies. The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. We hypothesized that the active form of Notch 1, the Notch 1 intracellular domain (NICD), would be overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and that depletion of NICD would lead to growth reduction.
Methods.
Following institutional review board approval, NICD expression was analyzed in human ovarian cancer specimens as well as the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3, SKOV3, and CaOV3. In addition, the effects of Notch 1 depletion on ovarian cancer cell growth were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) growth assay for 6 days following transfection with siRNA against Notch 1.
Results.
Western blot analysis revealed abundant NICD expression in all 3 ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as in 16 of 21 (76\%) human ovarian cancer samples. Following treatment with Notch 1 siRNA, expression of NICD was greatly reduced in all three cell lines. Furthermore, this depletion of NICD was associated with significant growth inhibition of all three ovarian cancer cell lines.
Conclusions.
NICD was frequently expressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and human ovarian cancer specimens. Importantly, depletion of Notch 1 led to growth inhibition of ovarian cancer cells. These findings support the hypothesis that Notch 1 plays a role in ovarian cancer proliferation, encouraging the investigation of this pathway as a therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.},

Hox genes confer positional identity to cells and tissues. Maintaining precise spatial patterns of Hox gene expression is vital during metazoan development. The transcriptional repressor CTCF is involved in the regulation of chromatin architecture. Narendra et al. show that a CTCF protein binding site insulates regions of active and repressed Hox gene expression from each other. This protects heterochromatin containing repressed Hox genes from the encroaching spread of active chromatin. The CTCF protein appears to organize the active and repressed chromatin regions into distinct architectural domains.
Science, this issue p. 1017
Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins encode the epigenetic memory of cellular positional identity by establishing inheritable domains of repressive and active chromatin within the Hox clusters. Here we demonstrate that the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) functions to insulate these adjacent yet antagonistic chromatin domains during embryonic stem cell differentiation into cervical motor neurons. Deletion of CTCF binding sites within the Hox clusters results in the expansion of active chromatin into the repressive domain. CTCF functions as an insulator by organizing Hox clusters into spatially disjoint domains. Ablation of CTCF binding disrupts topological boundaries such that caudal Hox genes leave the repressed domain and become subject to transcriptional activation. Hence, CTCF is required to insulate facultative heterochromatin from impinging euchromatin to produce discrete positional identities.
A DNA binding protein insulates and protects repressed topological domains in the genome from adjacent active regions.

Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure\textendash{}related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.

We evaluate the authenticity of ES cells in relation to cells in the embryo and examine their utility for dissecting mechanisms that confer pluripotency and that execute fate choice. We summarize current knowledge of the transcription factor circuitry that governs the ES cell state and discuss the opportunity to expose molecular logic further through iterative computational modeling and experimentation. Finally, we present a perspective on unresolved questions, including the challenge of deriving ground state pluripotent stem cells from non-rodent species.},

  abstract = {More than a thousand proteins are thought to contribute to mammalian chromatin and its regulation, but our understanding of the genomic occupancy and function of most of these proteins is limited. Here we describe an approach, which we call "chromatin proteomic profiling," to identify proteins associated with genomic regions marked by specifically modified histones. We used ChIP-MS to identify proteins associated with genomic regions marked by histones modified at specific lysine residues, including H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K79me2, H3K36me3, H3K9me3, and H4K20me3, in ES cells. We identified 332 known and 114 novel proteins associated with these histone-marked genomic segments. Many of the novel candidates have been implicated in various diseases, and their chromatin association may provide clues to disease mechanisms. More than 100 histone modifications have been described, so similar chromatin proteomic profiling studies should prove to be valuable for identifying many additional chromatin-associated proteins in a broad spectrum of cell types.},

In metazoans, much of the regulatory code that drives cell type-specific gene expression is located in distal elements called enhancers. Although mammalian genomes contain millions of potential enhancers, only a small subset of them is active in a given cell type. Cell type-specific enhancer selection involves the binding of lineage-determining transcription factors that prime enhancers. Signal-dependent transcription factors bind to primed enhancers, which enables these broadly expressed factors to regulate gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. The expression of genes that specify cell type identity and function is associated with densely spaced clusters of active enhancers known as super-enhancers. The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization.},

We generated a genome-wide interaction map of regulatory elements in human cells (ENCODE tier 1 cells, K562, GM12878) using Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) experiments targeting six broadly distributed factors. Bound regions covered 80\% of DNase I hypersensitive sites including 99.7\% of TSS and 98\% of enhancers. Correlating this map with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data sets revealed cohesin, CTCF, and ZNF143 as key components of three-dimensional chromatin structure and revealed how the distal chromatin state affects gene transcription. Comparison of interactions between cell types revealed that enhancer\textendash{}promoter interactions were highly cell-type-specific. Construction and comparison of distal and proximal regulatory networks revealed stark differences in structure and biological function. Proximal binding events are enriched at genes with housekeeping functions, while distal binding events interact with genes involved in dynamic biological processes including response to stimulus. This study reveals new mechanistic and functional insights into regulatory region organization in the nucleus.},

CTCF, the most characterized insulator-binding protein, has been implicated as a key genome organizer. However, little is known about CTCF-associated higher-order chromatin structures at a global scale. Here we applied chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET) sequencing to elucidate the CTCF-chromatin interactome in pluripotent cells. From this analysis, we identified 1,480 cis- and 336 trans-interacting loci with high reproducibility and precision. Associating these chromatin interaction loci with their underlying epigenetic states, promoter activities, enhancer binding and nuclear lamina occupancy, we uncovered five distinct chromatin domains that suggest potential new models of CTCF function in chromatin organization and transcriptional control. Specifically, CTCF interactions demarcate chromatin-nuclear membrane attachments and influence proper gene expression through extensive cross-talk between promoters and regulatory elements. This highly complex nuclear organization offers insights toward the unifying principles that govern genome plasticity and function.},

Yet, the factors involved and the mechanisms by which the 3D organization of the nucleus is established remain poorly understood. The use of Chromosome Conformation-Capture (3C)-based approaches has resulted in a new appreciation of the role of architectural proteins in the establishment of 3D genome organization. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.},

Insertion of the gypsy retrotransposon in the y2 allele at -700 bp from the start of transcription results in a spatially restricted phenotype: Mutant tissues are those in which yellow expression is controlled by enhancers located upstream from the insertion site, but all other structures whose enhancers are downstream of the insertion site are normally pigmented. This observation can be reproduced by inserting just a 430-bp fragment containing the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)]-binding region of gypsy into the same position where this element is inserted in y2, suggesting that the su(Hw)-binding region is sufficient to confer the mutant phenotype. Insertion of this sequence into various positions in the y gene gives rise to phenotypes that can be rationalized assuming that the presence of the su(Hw) protein inhibits the action of those tissue-specific enhancers that are located more distally from the su(Hw)-binding region with respect to the promoter. These results are discussed in light of current models that explain long-range effects of enhancers on gene expression.},

Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements distant from gene promoters. Although distal binding sites have been shown to regulate transcription by long-range chromatin interactions at a few loci, chromatin interactions and their impact on transcription regulation have not been investigated in a genome-wide manner. Here we describe the development of a new strategy, chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for the de novo detection of global chromatin interactions, with which we have comprehensively mapped the chromatin interaction network bound by oestrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER-$\alpha$) in the human genome. We found that most high-confidence remote ER-$\alpha$-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-$\alpha$ functions by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation. We propose that chromatin interactions constitute a primary mechanism for regulating transcription in mammalian genomes.},

  abstract = {Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and can be preserved in vitro in a naive inner-cell-mass-like configuration by providing exogenous stimulation with leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and small molecule inhibition of ERK1/ERK2 and GSK3$\beta$ signalling (termed 2i/LIF conditions). Hallmarks of naive pluripotency include driving Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) transcription by its distal enhancer, retaining a pre-inactivation X chromosome state, and global reduction in DNA methylation and in H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark deposition on developmental regulatory gene promoters. Upon withdrawal of 2i/LIF, naive mouse ES cells can drift towards a primed pluripotent state resembling that of the post-implantation epiblast. Although human ES cells share several molecular features with naive mouse ES cells, they also share a variety of epigenetic properties with primed murine epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). These include predominant use of the proximal enhancer element to maintain OCT4 expression, pronounced tendency for X chromosome inactivation in most female human ES cells, increase in DNA methylation and prominent deposition of H3K27me3 and bivalent domain acquisition on lineage regulatory genes. The feasibility of establishing human ground state naive pluripotency in vitro with equivalent molecular and functional features to those characterized in mouse ES cells remains to be defined. Here we establish defined conditions that facilitate the derivation of genetically unmodified human naive pluripotent stem cells from already established primed human ES cells, from somatic cells through induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming or directly from blastocysts. The novel naive pluripotent cells validated herein retain molecular characteristics and functional properties that are highly similar to mouse naive ES cells, and distinct from conventional primed human pluripotent cells. This includes competence in the generation of cross-species chimaeric mouse embryos that underwent organogenesis following microinjection of human naive iPS cells into mouse morulas. Collectively, our findings establish new avenues for regenerative medicine, patient-specific iPS cell disease modelling and the study of early human development in vitro and in vivo.},

  abstract = {Author Summary In eukaryotes, enhancers directly contact promoters over large genomic distances to regulate gene expression. Characterizing the principles underlying these long-range enhancer-promoter contacts is crucial for a full understanding of gene expression. Recent experimental mapping of chromosomal interactions by the Hi-C method shows an intricate network of local looping interactions surrounding enhancers and promoters. We model a region of chromatin fiber as a long polymer and study how the formation of loops between certain regulatory elements can insulate or facilitate enhancer-promoter interactions. We find 2\textendash{}5 fold insulation or facilitation, depending on the location of looping elements relative to an enhancer-promoter pair. These effects originate from the polymer nature of chromatin, without requiring additional mechanisms beyond the formation of a chromatin loop. Our findings suggest that loop-mediated gene regulation by elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can be understood as an allosteric effect. This highlights the complex effects that local chromatin organization can have on gene regulation.},

We observed a significant excess in the directional consistency of T2D risk alleles across ancestry groups, even at SNPs demonstrating only weak evidence of association. By following up the strongest signals of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, we identified seven new T2D susceptibility loci. Furthermore, we observed considerable improvements in the fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals at several T2D susceptibility loci. These observations highlight the benefits of trans-ethnic GWAS for the discovery and characterization of complex trait loci and emphasize an exciting opportunity to extend insight into the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of human diseases across populations of diverse ancestry.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The insulin-like growth-factor 2 (IGF2) mRNA binding protein p62 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. Still, its potential role in liver disease is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated pathophysiological implications of p62 overexpression in mice.
METHODS: We generated mice overexpressing p62 under a LAP-promotor. mRNA expression levels and stability were examined by real-time RT-PCR. Allele-specific expression of Igf2 and H19 was assessed after crossing mice with SD7 animals. The Igf2 downstream mediators pAKT and PTEN were determined by Western blot.
RESULTS: Hepatic p62 overexpression neither induced inflammatory processes nor liver damage. However, 2.5week old transgenic animals displayed a steatotic phenotype and improved glucose tolerance. p62 overexpression induced the expression of the imprinted genes Igf2 and H19 and their transcriptional regulator Aire (autoimmune regulator). Neither monoallelic expression nor mRNA stability of Igf2 and H19 was affected. Investigating Igf2 downstream signalling pathways showed increased AKT activation and attenuated PTEN expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The induction of a steatotic phenotype implies that p62 plays a role in hepatic pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {The ribosome can change its reading frame during translation in a process known as programmed ribosomal frameshifting. These rare events are supported by complex mRNA signals. However, we found that the ciliates Euplotes crassus and Euplotes focardii exhibit widespread frameshifting at stop codons. 47 different codons preceding stop signals resulted in either +1 or +2 frameshifts, with the +1 frameshifting at AAA being the most frequent. The frameshifts show unusual plasticity and rapid evolution, and have little influence on translation rates. Proximity of a stop codon to the 3${'}$-mRNA end rather than its occurrence or sequence context appeared to designate termination. Thus, a stop codon is not a sufficient signal for translation termination, and the default function of stop codons in Euplotes is frameshifting, whereas termination is specific to certain mRNA positions and likely requires additional factors.},

  abstract = {Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) has been identified as a mechanism to regulate the expression of many viral genes and some cellular genes. The slippery site of -1 PRF has been well characterized, whereas the +1 PRF signal and the mechanism involved in +1 PRF remain poorly understood. Previous study confirmed that +1 PRF is required for the synthesis of protein products in several genes of ciliates from the genus Euplotes. To accurately assess the frequency of genes requiring frameshift in Euplotes, the macronuclear genome and transcriptome of Euplotes octocarinatus were analyzed in this study. A total of 3,700 +1 PRF candidate genes were identified from 32,353 transcripts, and the gene products of these putative +1 PRFs were mainly identified as protein kinases. Furthermore, we reported a putative suppressor tRNA of UAA which may provide new insights into the mechanism of +1 PRF in euplotids. For the first time, our transcriptome-wide survey of +1 PRF in E. octocarinatus provided a dataset which serves as a valuable resource for the future understanding of the mechanism underlying +1 PRF.},

  abstract = {The Tec1 and Tec2 transposons of the ciliate Euplotes crassus carry a gene for a tyrosine-type site-specific recombinase. The expression of the Tec2 gene apparently uses a programmed +1 frameshift. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether this gene has evolved under purifying selection in Tec1 and Tec2. Each element carries three genes, and each has evolved under purifying selection for the function of its encoded protein, as evidenced by a dearth of nonsynonymous changes. This distortion of divergence is apparent in codons both 5${'}$ and 3${'}$ of the frameshift site. Thus, Tec2 transposons have diverged from each other while using a programmed +1 frameshift to produce recombinase, the function of which is under purifying selection. What might this function be? Tyrosine-type site-specific recombinases are extremely rare in eukaryotes, and Tec elements are the first known eukaryotic type II transposons to encode a site-specific recombinase. Tec elements also encode a widespread transposase. The Tec recombinase might function in transposition, resolve products of transposition (bacterial replicative transposons use recombinase or resolvase to separate joined replicons), or provide a function that benefits the ciliate host. Transposons in ciliated protozoa are removed from the macronucleus, and it has been proposed that the transposons provide this ``excisase'' activity.},

  abstract = {The nucleoside analog 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) induced marked changes in the differentiated state of cultured mouse embryo cells and also inhibited the methylation of newly synthesized DNA. The DNA strand containing 5-aza-CR remained undermethylated in the round of DNA synthesis following analog incorporation. The extent of inhibition of DNA modification and induction of muscle cells in treated cultures were dependent on the 5-aza-CR concentration over a narrow dose range. Experiments with the restriction enzyme Hpa II, which is sensitive to cytosine methylation in the sequence CCGG, demonstrated that the DNA synthesized in 5-aza-CR-treated cultures was maximally undermethylated 48 hr after treatment. Three other analogs of cytidine, containing a modification in the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring [5-aza-2${'}$-deoxycytidine(5-aza-CdR), pseudoisocytidine ($\psi$ICR) and 5-fluoro-2${'}$-deoxycytidine(FCdR)] also induced the formation of muscle cells and inhibited DNA methylation. In contrast, 1-$\beta$-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and 6-azacytidine (6-aza-CR) did not inhibit DNA methylation or induce muscle formation, whereas 5-6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (dH-aza-CR) was a poor inducer of muscle cells and a poor inhibitor of DNA methylation. These results provide experimental evidence for a role for DNA modification in differentiation, and suggest that cytidine analogs containing an altered 5 position perturb previously established methylation patterns to yield new cellular phenotypes.},

conserved protein known as CTCF, which plays a key role in the establishment of
the chromosomal architecture in vertebrates. The distinctive features of C2H2
zinc finger proteins include strong and specific binding to a long and unique
DNA recognition target sequence and rapid expansion within various animal taxa
during evolution. The reviewed data support a proposed model according to which
many of the C2H2 proteins have functions that are similar to those of the CTCF
