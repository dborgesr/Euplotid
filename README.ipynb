    "Composed of a set of constantly updating pipelines running on Docker images which enable a user to build and annotate Insulated Neighborhoods(INs)starting from raw sequencing reads of DNA-interactions, Chromatin Accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools (RSEM, STAR, Origami, HiCPro) and the results are normalized, quality-checked and stored. INs are then built using a Louvain based graph partioning algorithm. CREs (as defined by Chromatin Accessibility) are then assigned to TSSs based on inclusion within the same IN and TF binding at each peak is annotated using a trained neural network architecture. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D and 3D ways.\n",
